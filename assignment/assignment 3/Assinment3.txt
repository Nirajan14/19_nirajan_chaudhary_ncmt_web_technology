CHAPTER 3: WEBSITE STRUCTURE DESIGN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
    Answer:
        Information Architecture (IA) is the process of **organizing, structuring, and labeling website content so that users can easily find information and navigate the site.
        It focuses on menus, categories, navigation paths, and content hierarchy to improve usability and user experience.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. What is a “Wireframe”?
    Answer:
        A wireframe is a basic visual blueprint of a website or webpage that shows the layout, structure, and placement of elements such as headers, navigation menus, content areas, and buttons—without colors, images, or final design details.
        It helps designers plan functionality before visual design begins.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Explain the concept of “Cognitive Friction” in web design.
    Answer:
        Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort required by users to understand and use a website.
        When navigation is confusing, labels are unclear, or layout is cluttered, users must think harder, which causes frustration and increases the chance of leaving the site.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
    Answer:
        Hyphens (`-`) are preferred because:
            * Search engines treat hyphens as word separators
            * Underscores (`_`) are read as a single word
            * Hyphens improve readability and SEO

        Example:
            * Good: `my-website-design`
            * Bad: `my_website_design`

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure. Give an example of when to use each.
    Answer:
        | Aspect            | Hierarchical Structure                    | Linear Structure                    |
        | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
        | Structure         | - Tree-like with parent-child pages       | - Step-by-step sequence             |
        | Navigation        | - Multiple paths                          | - One path only                     |
        | Complexity        | - Suitable for large websites             | - Suitable for small content        |
        | Flexibility       | - High                                    | - Low                               |

        Examples:
            * Hierarchical: University website (Home → Faculty → Department → Course)
            * Linear: Online exam, checkout process, tutorial steps

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Explain the ”Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.
    Answer:
        The Three-Click Rule states that users should be able to find any information on a website within three clicks from the homepage. The main idea behind this rule is to reduce user frustration and mental effort while navigating a website. If users are forced to click too many times to reach their desired information, they may feel confused, impatient, or lost, which often results in them leaving the website.
        From a User Experience (UX) perspective, the rule emphasizes efficiency and clarity in navigation design. Users usually visit a website with a specific goal, such as finding information, completing a task, or making a purchase. When the path to that goal is long or unclear, it increases cognitive friction, causing dissatisfaction.

        Significance:
            * Improves usability
            * Reduces user frustration
            * Encourages user engagement
            * Helps in better navigation planning

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. ”Plan before you do.” Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure.
    Answer:
        * Card Sorting:
        Users group content into categories that make sense to them. This helps designers create user-friendly navigation and menus.

        * Flowcharts:
        Flowcharts visually represent how users move from one page to another, helping designers plan logical navigation paths and reduce confusion.

        Both tools ensure better information architecture and usability before development begins.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. You are designing a website for a University. It has hundreds of pages (Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News). Which structural model would you choose? Draw a rough diagram and justify your choice.
    Answer:
        Chosen Model: Hierarchical (Tree) Structure

        Justification:
            * University websites have hundreds of pages
            * Content is naturally divided into categories
            * Easy to expand and maintain
            * Supports logical navigation

        Rough Diagram:

        Home
        ├── Admissions
        │    ├── Undergraduate
        │    ├── Postgraduate
        ├── Departments
        │    ├── Science
        │    ├── Management
        ├── Alumni
        ├── News

    9. A user visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation menu, which is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen. Analyze this design failure using the ”KISS” (Keep It Simple) principle.
    Answer:
        Problem:
            The navigation menu is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen.

        KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
            * Design should be simple and obvious
            * Hiding navigation increases cognitive friction
            * Desktop users expect visible menus

        Analysis:
            * Users cannot quickly find navigation
            * Causes frustration within seconds
            * Leads to high bounce rate

        Solution:
            * Display full navigation menu on desktop
            * Use icons only where appropriate
            * Reduce unnecessary complexity

    10. An e-commerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9. Explain why this is bad for both users and Search Engines (SEO), and propose a better structure using Page Slugs.
    Answer:
        Given URL:
        `www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9`

        Why this is bad:
            * Difficult for users to understand
            * Not SEO-friendly
            * No descriptive keywords
            * Hard to remember or share

        Better URL Using Page Slugs:
            `www.shop.com/electronics/smartphone-samsung-galaxy`

        Benefits:
            * User-friendly
            * SEO-optimized
            * Clear content meaning
            * Better search engine ranking
