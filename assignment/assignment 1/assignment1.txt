Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

    1. Define the term ”Protocol” in the context of the Internet.
    Answer: In Internet, a protocol is a a standardized set of rules and conventions that govern how devices format, send, receive, and interpret data, acting as a common language for digital communication, like TCP/IP, HTTP, or SMTP, ensuring diverse hardware and software can understand each other for reliable information exchange across networks.

    2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?
    Answer: A Web Browser Retrieves and displays web pages using a search engine or entered URL. While a Search Engine Helps users find information from the World Wide Web by returning relevant web pages.

    3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
    Answer: The World Wide Web (WWW), often called the Web, is a system of interconnected webpages and information that you can access using the Internet. It was created to help people share and find information easily, using links that connect different pages together.

    4. Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
    Answer: In static web pages, Pages will remain same until someone changes it manually. In dynamic web pages, Content of pages are different for different visitors.

    5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
    Answer: Client-server architecture is a cornerstone of modern system design, where the network infrastructure is structured to include multiple clients and a central server. In this model, clients are devices or programs that make requests for services or resources, while the server is a powerful machine or software that fulfills these requests. Communication between clients and the server follows a request-response protocol, such as HTTP/HTTPS for web services or SQL for database queries.
        - This architecture allows for efficient data management and resource allocation by centralizing critical functions on the server, which can handle complex processing and large-scale data storage.
        - Clients manage user interactions and send specific requests to the server, which processes these requests and sends back appropriate responses.
        - The client-server architecture is highly scalable, as it can accommodate more clients by scaling the server's capabilities or adding additional servers.
        - This design is prevalent in various applications, including web services, database management, and email systems, providing a robust framework for developing and managing complex, distributed systems efficiently.

    6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
    Answer: 
        Internet services:
        To access/exchange a large amount of data such as software, audio clips, video clips, text files, other documents, etc., we need internet services. You must use an Internet service to connect to the Internet. Data can be sent from Internet servers to your machine via Internet service.
        
        E-Mail: Used to send electronic mail via the internet. It is a paperless method for sending text, images, documents, videos, etc from one person to another via the internet.
        FTP (File Transfer Protocol): To share, transfer, or send a file or logical data item across several users and/or machines, both locally and remotely.
        VoIP: It stands for Voice over Internet Protocol, which describes how to make and receive phone calls over the internet. A larger number of people believe VoIP is a viable alternative to traditional landlines. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is a technique that helps us make voice calls via the Internet rather than over a traditional (or analog) phone line. 

    7. ”The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works
    Answer:
        - A network is a group of connected computers that are able to send data to each other. A computer network is much like a social circle, which is a group of people who all know each other, regularly exchange information, and coordinate activities together.
        - The Internet is a vast, sprawling collection of networks that connect to each other. In fact, the word "Internet" could be said to come from this concept: interconnected networks.
        - Since computers connect to each other within networks and these networks also all connect with each other, one computer can talk to another computer in a faraway network thanks to the Internet. This makes it possible to rapidly exchange information between computers across the world.
        - Computers connect to each other and to the Internet via wires, cables, radio waves, and other types of networking infrastructure. All data sent over the Internet is translated into pulses of light or electricity, also called "bits," and then interpreted by the receiving computer. The wires, cables, and radio waves conduct these bits at the speed of light. The more bits that can pass over these wires and cables at once, the faster the Internet works.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

    8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
    Answer:
        As a consultant, I would not agree with the advice to use a dynamic website in this case.

        The company’s requirements are:

        * Same information for all visitors
        * Very low maintenance cost

        These requirements are best met by a static website, not a dynamic one.

        Why a static website is more suitable

        - Low maintenance: Static websites do not require databases, server-side scripting, or frequent updates.
        - Lower cost: Hosting and development costs are minimal compared to dynamic websites.
        - Better performance: Pages load faster because content is pre-built.
        - Higher security: No database or backend logic reduces vulnerability to attacks.
        - Ideal for fixed content: Since the content is the same for all users, there is no need for personalization or dynamic content generation.

        Why a dynamic website is unnecessary

        * Dynamic websites are useful when:

            - Content changes frequently
            - User interaction, login systems, or personalization is required
            - Data is fetched from databases
        * They involve:

            - Higher development and hosting costs
            - Regular maintenance (updates, security patches, database management)

        For a startup that displays identical information to all visitors and wants very low maintenance costs, a static website is the best and most cost-effective solution. Using a dynamic website would add unnecessary complexity and expense without providing meaningful benefits.
    
    9. A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not Found” error, even though the internet connection is active. However, accessing the site via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that failed
    Answer: 
        Diagnosis of the Problem

        The problem is with DNS (Domain Name System).

        When the user types [www.google.com](http://www.google.com), the browser asks a DNS server to convert the website name into an IP address. In this case, the DNS server failed, so the browser shows **“Server Not Found.”**

        However, when the user types 142.250.190.46, the website opens because this is Google’s IP address, and the browser does not need DNS to find the server.

        ### Underlying Technology That Failed

        The DNS system failed.

        DNS works like a phonebook:

        - Website name ([www.google.com](http://www.google.com)) → IP address (142.250.190.46)

        Since the DNS could not translate the name into the IP address, the website could not be opened using the name, even though the internet connection was working.

    10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers but does not want this information available to the general public. Explain which network type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why
    Answer:
        * An Intranet is used only inside the company by employees.
        * The Internet is public and anyone can access it.
        * An Extranet allows a company to share limited and secure information with trusted external partners, such as suppliers.

        # Why Extranet is the best choice
            - Only selected suppliers can access the inventory data.
            - The information is not available to the public.
            - Access is controlled using login and security rules.
            - It allows safe data sharing between the company and its suppliers.
