Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.
    A Sitemap is an organized outline of all the web pages of a website and how they are connected. It helps developers plan the structure, navigation, and flow of the website before actual development begins.

2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?
    The Launch phase is the final stage where the fully developed website is published on a live server. After final testing and approval, the site becomes accessible to real users on the internet.

3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
    Documentation is essential because it explains the system’s design, features, and working process. It helps developers understand the project easily, supports maintenance, and makes future upgrades or changes simpler.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
        Front-end Development	                        Back-end Development
        - Focuses on visual design and layout	        - Focuses on server operations
        - Handles user interaction	                    - Handles data processing
        - Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript	                - Uses PHP, Python, Java, databases
        - Works inside the browser	                    - Works on the server
        - Emphasizes user experience	                - Emphasizes data storage and logic

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

5. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss.
    Planning is considered the most important phase because it sets the foundation for the entire web project. A well-planned project reduces confusion, errors, and unnecessary costs during development.
    Major tasks in the planning phase include:
        - Defining project objectives
        - Understanding client needs
        - Identifying the target users
        - Preparing sitemaps and wireframes
        - Choosing suitable technologies
        - Estimating budget and schedule
    Without proper planning, the project may face delays, poor quality, or failure to meet user expectations.

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?
    The Maintenance phase is continuous and repetitive because it starts after the website goes live and never completely ends. Websites require regular improvements to remain effective.
    Maintenance includes:
        - Updating website content
        - Fixing technical issues
        - Improving speed and performance
        - Strengthening security
        - Adding new features
    A website is never fully “finished” because technology evolves, user needs change, and content must stay updated.

7. Describe the process of Information Gathering. Why is understanding the target audience important?
    Information Gathering is the first step of web development where developers collect all necessary details from the client.
    This process includes:
        - Meetings and discussions with clients
        - Understanding business objectives
        - Studying competitor websites
        - Identifying functional requirements
    Knowing the target audience is important because it helps create a website that matches user preferences, improves usability, and increases user satisfaction and engagement.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

8. Client wants to skip the Testing phase. Explain the risks.
    Avoiding the Testing phase can cause serious problems such as:
        - Security threats due to untested vulnerabilities
        - Malfunctioning features like forms or payments
        - Device and browser compatibility issues
        - Poor user experience due to bugs
        - Testing ensures the website works correctly, safely, and smoothly. Skipping it can result in loss of users and reputation.

9. Developer starts coding without design or sitemap. Analyze the issue.
    The developer ignored the Planning and Design phases, leading to confusion and poor results.
    Problems caused:
        - No clear website structure
        - Unclear client requirements
        - No approved layout or design
    Correct workflow:
        - Gather requirements
        - Design sitemap and wireframes
        - Get client approval
        - Start development
    Following proper steps helps avoid rework and client dissatisfaction.

10. University website became outdated. Which phase was neglected?
    The Maintenance phase was ignored.
    This phase involves:
        - Updating notices, results, and schedules
        - Fixing broken links and errors
        - Monitoring performance
        - Improving security
        - Updating features when required
    Neglecting maintenance results in outdated information and reduced trust from users.
